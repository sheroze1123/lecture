## How many are you?

In the first lecture, we ran a parallel protocol for counting attendance:

 - Rightmost person per row counts all in row
 - When done counting, raises hand
 - State number in row when called on

after which the instructor gets to gather and sum the row counts.

In practice, this took X time.  This includes

 - Time to start the process
 - Time to compute row counts
 - Time for the instructor to gather counts
 - Time for instructor to do the arithmetic

Consider the following questions:

1. What is a simple model that would predict this time?

    If N is the total number of students, R the number of rows, G the gather time, S the 
    start time, C the row compute time and A the gather arithmetic time, then the total time is,
        N/R * C + S + (G+A)R

2. What about a simple model to predict time for one person to count?

    If N is the total number of students and A is the time to add one to the total, the total time,
        N*A

3. How big should the class be before the parallel method takes less time?
        N/R * C + S + (G+A)R < N*A
